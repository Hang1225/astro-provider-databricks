# cosmos

A framework for generating Apache Airflow DAGs from other workflows.

### Development

We use pre-commit to run a number of checks on the code before committing. To install pre-commit, run:

```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
```

To run the checks manually, run:

```bash
    pre-commit run --all-files
```
